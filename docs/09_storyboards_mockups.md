# Storyboards and Mockups

Finally, we come to storyboards and Mockups.

## Storyboards

In filmmaking, part of the process is storyboarding. In this process, the production staff produces what looks like a
comic book of each step of a scene. In the filmmaking process, this is useful for determining camera angles, what
characters are in frame, how action moves within the frame, and how things are paced.

The same can work in software development! Storyboards are useful for **illustrating user actions and software response**.

## Mockups

Mockups are common in User Experience design. A mockup is a non-functional Graphical User Interface and is obviously
good for **identifying controls and seeing what the user will ultimately see and interact with**. Mockups

## Combining their powers

Mockups are common, but their utility is limited. When you combine those mockups into storyboards, however, you get
rich and robust ways of illustrating user interaction patterns, and cause-effect relationships (which can help backup 
your [truth tables](08_truth_table.md)).

Take the Notepad example from the [Workflow Diagrams](04_workflow.md) section. This could also be written as a 
storyboard!
