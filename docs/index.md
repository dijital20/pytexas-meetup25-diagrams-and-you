# Introduction

## Why do I care?

Whether you are a professional software developer or just a hobbyist using Python to create your own scripts, being able
to communicate your ideas is a critical skill. Whether you are trying to collaborate with others on the development
or support of your creations, or sending yourself a "message in a bottle" so that you can someday understand why you
did that thing you did, communication is key.

Humans are visual creatures, and a picture truly is worth a thousand words. I've seen a well placed diagram end an hour
of round-and-round conversation. Diagrams are one really honking good way to express complicated ideas.

## Who is this guy?

Hi! I'm **Josh Schneider**! 

I'm a community organizer with the [**PyTexas Conference**](https://pytexas.org) and 
[**PyTexas Virtual Meetup**](https://pytexas.org/meetup). Currently, I and working as an **Application Security Engineer**, 
but over the course of my career, I've also been a **Test Automation Architect and Engineer**, **Product Owner**, 
**Tool Developer**, and **Technical Support**. I've seen software from the raw ideas out to real customers using it. I 
like to say that I have "circle-strafed the software development lifecycle".

When I am not nerding it up, I enjoy coffee, movies, improv comedy, beer, and gaming.
