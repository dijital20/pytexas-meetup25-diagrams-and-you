# PyTexas Meetup 2025 - Diagrams and You!

Welcome to the repo for the talk "Diagrams and You" from the PyTexas Virtual Meetup.

## Description

Before and After you code, you have to be able to communicate your ideas, both to yourself and to others. With humans being the visual creatures that we are, one of the most effective ways to communicate complex ideas is with a diagram. I mean, cave drawings worked for early man, why can't they work for engineers, right?

Come along as Josh talks about several types of diagrams, their properties, their faults, and what they're good for!

## Building the documentation

Depedencies are managed via [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). You should be able to setup a virtual environment and install the dependencies using `uv sync` or by running `uv run mkdocs serve`.

Static HTML pages will also be available for download via the Github releases.
